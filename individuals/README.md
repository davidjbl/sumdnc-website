# Individual Workspaces

This directory contains personal workspaces for team members to experiment and develop features.

## Structure

Each team member gets their own subdirectory:

```
individuals/
├── alice/
├── bob/
└── charlie/
```

## Usage

Personal workspaces are for:
- Experimental features
- Personal scripts and tools
- Learning and prototyping
- Individual configurations

## Guidelines

1. Keep your workspace organized
2. Don't commit sensitive data
3. Document your experiments
4. Share useful findings with the team

## Adding Your Workspace

```powershell
cd individuals
mkdir your-name
cd your-name
# Start experimenting!
```

**Note**: Individual workspaces are gitignored by default. Add your own `.gitignore` if needed.
